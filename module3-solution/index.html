        The argument that John makes is sound: that designers shouldn’t be using dummy text in place of relevant content. I completely
        agree that designers should place content first! Start with content, then add structure, a logical progression of
        thought and aesthetic styling. That being said, saying that there’s absolutely no need for filler text is definitely
        shortsighted. From the small perspective that McGarvey frames the argument, he’s right. However, if we take a step
        back, we can see that there are still tons of possible and legitimate uses for lorem ipsum. In a nice theoretical
        web design workflow, designers have complete control over content and the progression of the design. In the real
        world, those who pay designers demand mockups before providing content. Perhaps there’s a paragraph of legal copy
        that the designer needs to consider in the layout but won’t actually receive from the legal department until much
        further down the road. Or maybe the PHP guy needs to test his new page generating script simply to see if it works.
        There’s also the consideration of blog template designers, who do in fact need to design content containers that
        work for a variety of different purposes. My point is, think twice about using filler content when you have the power
        to do otherwise but don’t hesitate to realize that there are legitimate situations where tossing in some placeholder
        copy won’t represent the utter destruction of the integrity of the design industry. With that argument out of the
        way, we can get to the good stuff! Here are 30 awesome placeholder content generators.
